Thumbnails can be enabled easily by setting the `thumbnail` parameter in the frontmatter to an image such as `"images/landscape.jpg"`.

Make sure to copy the image the `static/images/` directory.

Here are some example images:

![Test Image 1](/images/test1.jpg)
![Test Image 2](/images/test2.jpg)

If put together, it will look like this (that's in fact this post's frontmatter):

```md
